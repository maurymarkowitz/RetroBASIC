RetroBASIC TODO/BUGS/ERRATA list

MS = MS BASIC, 6502 40-bit version
HP = HP Time-Sharing BASIC
AB = Atari BASIC
IB = Integer BASIC (aka Apple BASIC)
GW = GW-BASIC
WB = Wang BASIC
PA = Palo Alto Tiny BASIC

- add slicing-based concat, A(10) = B(5,10)

- most non-HP dialects invisibly DIM A(10) for any variable that does not have an explicit DIM. This means one can A(5)=25 without a DIM A() statement. This is rarely (if ever?) used in actual code, but should be added.

- add TIME, TIME$ and DATE$

- test and error on incorrect nesting of FOR loops, which we currently ignore

- need to allow multiple INPUTs on a single line, currently it requires a CR between values

- DEFINT/SNG/DBL/STR does not support the "range" syntax, DEFINT A-F. only comma lists work, DEFINT A,B

- needs command-line switch for ANSI, controls tab stops and many errors

- support Dartmouth/ANSI style FOR loops which skip the body if the test fails on the first loop

- ELSE would be realtively easy to add, at least the single-line variety

- flesh out GET and PUT, which are just placeholders for now

- support AB's DEG and RAD modes? WB also had gradians; SELECT G

- PA allows multiple assignments in a LET, separated by commas, see assignlist

- PA allows single or double quotes around strings

- PA allows # to define field widths in PRINT, so PRINT A,#3,B,C will print B and C in 3-character widths. All expressions following the format use that format until reset by another # or another PRINT

- PA prints a colon after INPUTs, not ?, and prints the variable name if no prompt is given. So "INPUT A" prints "A:", while INPUT "TYPE A NUMBER"A prints "TYPE A NUMBER:"

- LPOS, LPRINT, etc. from AB, GW and others

- file handling, OPEN, PRINT# etc.

- CINT CSNG CDBL are not implemented

- GW BASIC string formatters in PRINT USING, but number formats work

Will not be done:

- WB allows RESTORE to use an ordinal position in the list, as opposed to a line number. There appears to be no easy way to distinguish this.

- WB uses CONVERT for ASC, which steps on HPs CONVERT

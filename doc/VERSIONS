RetroBASIC version history

Version 1.0 - initial release, 2020

- basic functionality needed to run all games in BASIC Computer Games
- limited to the syntax and features of early MS BASICS like Commodore BASIC 1.x
- user defined functions do not substitute parameter values, they calculate
    based on the value of the same named global variable (**bug**)

Version 1.1 - 2 June 2022

- added support for ANSI and HP style string slicing
- user defined functions correctly use local variables and expressions
- refactored code into a more cannonical C form

Version 1.2 - 19 July 2022

- removed GString and replaced them with normal C char-based strings

Version 1.3 - 18 August 2022

- removed GList, GTree and the GLib library itself
- added UCASE and LCASE
- added CHANGE command from Dartmouth v4, which required...
- arrays/matrices now have an index 0 no matter the value of OPTION BASE.
    this is because the length of the string is placed in index 0.
    a 1-based system that accesses 0 will no longer cause an error but
    this should not occur in known-good code
- added several changes to allow building using the makefile (thanks SK!)

Version 1.4 - 2 September 2022

- removing POSIX and GNU calls to make it more compatible with MSVC

Version 1.5 - 22 October 2022

- using stdbool instead of rolling my own boolean enum
- added CLR, the MS analog of CLEAR
- added TIME, TIME$, and the ability to reset the clock
- added unDIMed variables, all subscrips now have a minimum dimension of 11 (0 to 10)

Version 1.6 - 31 December 2022

- added code to check real DIM limits even if defaulted to 11

Version 1.6.2 - 2 January 2023

- added SEG and SUBSTR, aliases for MID found in PDP-8 and others

Version 1.6.3 - 2 January 2023

- fix SEG, which uses start and end positions, not a length

Version 1.7.0 - 30 May 2023

- initial support for string slicing dialects like HP and Atari, use -s flag
- added missing comparison operators for strings, <, >, <=, >=

Version 1.7.2 - 16 July 2023

- added statistic for average number of digits in a line number

Version 1.8.0 - 3 October 2023

- added array-slicing for string assignments - LET A$(4:5)="B"
- refactored some of the code to support that, added slice_limits and variable_storage funcs
- renamed variable_t to variable_value_t for clarity
- added HEX, OCT, BIN, HEX$, OCT$, BIN$
- fixed bug in STRING$ when passing ASCII numbers

Version 1.8.1 - 2 November 2023

- added amazing.bas, which led to...
- refactored setup of arrays so that you can pass in variables - DIM A(X,Y)

Version 1.8.2 - 7 November 2023

- add UBOUND and LBOUND (mostly for testing purposes)
- added PAUSE statement, used to wait for input or pause for a given time
- added hex, oct and bin constants, for instance, &FFFF, or 0b10101010

Version 1.8.3 - 9 November 2023

- added LABEL statement, which allows branches to named lines
- fixed a problem setting up array sizes at runtime that caused amazing to fail at 2x2

Version 1.8.4 - 9 November 2023

- merged FOR and GOSUB stacks so that a RETURN correctly pops off any local FORs
- added POP for manual stack pops
- fixed an error in octal constants that caused SST to fail to parse
